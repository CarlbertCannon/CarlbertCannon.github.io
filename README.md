						Intro 
						
						"About"
								My journey
							
								It started by watching videos on Youtube. A few of them were about breaking down the differences between Software Engineering and Software Development, as well as what it means to be a front-end developer and a back-end developer. Web development piqued my interest too, so I also watched videos about that as well. Then I got into looking at tutorials and reading books about JavaScript and C#. I finally started practicing with apps such as Sololearn and GrassHopper. 
								After all of this research I knew I needed to see which type of learning style would best suit me. I explored self learning as well bootcamps. I looked into a few bootcamps and after talking with Cruz Sanchez from TrueCoders. The way he explained himself about the structure of the course as well as the reviews I read about the program. I knew it was the right one for me.
								
								Before I enrolled with TrueCoders I had to decide on which course I wanted to take. It came down to their Software Engineering and Web Development program; whether or not I wanted to do it on my own with their self paced program or go in as a full time student. I ulitimately went with the full stack software engineering program along with the flex schedule. This afforded me to work full-time as well as study during my free time.
								
								I really enjoyed the process of becoming a Software Engineer. It was challeging at times but very rewarding overall. I must say I enjoy creating websites, working with applications and solving by way of debugging.

								Projects
								
								"https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/OpenWeatherMapAPI(Open Weather Map API)</b></a> Here I created a weather forecast app using an Open Weather Map API. It will give you the current weather for the city that you specify. </p>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/KanyeWest"><b>(KayneRest Project)</b></a> This project uses randomly generated quotes from Kanye West and Ron Swanson by way of <a href="https://api.kanye.rest">The KanyeWest API</a > and <a href="https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes">The RonSwanson API</a>. When you run this application it will appear as if the two are having a conversation.</p>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/BestBuyBestPractices"><b>(Best Buy Project)</b></a> This project connects using a BestBuy API that lists products sold by Best Buy. The console connects to the API so you can essentially view all of the products. I can also create, update, read, and delete products from the list.</p>
								<p><a href="https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/TacoParser"><b>(TacoParser Project)</b></a> This project goes through a list of Taco Bell locations and essentially find the two that are farthest away from another by mileage.</p>
