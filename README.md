#  My coding journey thus far!
							
> It started by watching videos on Youtube. A few of them were about breaking down the differences between 
> Software Engineering and Software Development, as well as what it means to be a front-end developer and a 
> back-end developer. Web development piqued my interest too, so I also watched videos about that as well. 

> Then I got into looking at tutorials and reading books about JavaScript and C#. 
> I finally started practicing with apps such as Sololearn and GrassHopper. 
> After all of this research I knew I needed to see which type of learning style would best suit me.
> explored self learning as well bootcamps. I looked into a few bootcamps and after talking with 
> Cruz Sanchez from TrueCoders. The way he explained himself about the structure of the course as well 
> as the reviews I read about the program. I knew it was the right one for me.
								
								
> Before I enrolled with TrueCoders I had to decide on which course I wanted to take. It came down to their 
> Software Engineering and Web Development program; whether or not I wanted to do it on my own with their self 
> paced program or go in as a full time student. I ulitimately went with the full stack software engineering program 
> along with the flex schedule. This afforded me to work full-time as well as study during my free time.
								
> I really enjoyed the process of becoming a Software Engineer. It was challeging at times but very rewarding overall. 
> I must say I enjoy creating websites, working with applications and solving by way of debugging.
> Take a glance at some of my work throughout my time with TrueCoders.
						

 #  Experience 
							
##  Projects
								
## - [Open Weather Map API](https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/OpenWeatherMapAPI) Here I created a weather forecast app using an Open Weather Map API. It will give you the current weather for the city that you specify.

## - [KayneRest Project](https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/KanyeWest) This project uses randomly generated quotes from Kanye West and Ron Swanson by way of [KanyeWest API](https://api.kanye.rest) and [The RonSwanson API](https://ron-swanson-quotes.herokuapp.com/v2/quotes). When you run this application it will appear as if the two are having a conversation.

## - [Best Buy Project](https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/BestBuyBestPractices) This project connects using a BestBuy API that lists products sold by Best Buy. The console connects to the API so you can essentially view all of the products. I can also create, update, read, and delete products from the list.

## - [TacoParser](https://github.com/CarlbertCannon/TacoParser) This project goes through a list of Taco Bell locations and essentially find the two that are farthest away from another by mileage.
